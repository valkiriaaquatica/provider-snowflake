                      (Set of String) A list of security integrations the authentication policy is associated with. This parameter has no effect when saml or oauth are not in the authentication_methods list. All values in the security_integrations list must be compatible with the values in the authentication_methods list. For example, if security_integrations contains a SAML security integration, and authentication_methods contains OAUTH, then you cannot create the authentication policy. To allow all security integrations use ALL as parameter.
